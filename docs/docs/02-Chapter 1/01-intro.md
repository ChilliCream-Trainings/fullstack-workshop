# The Beginning

In this chapter, we will explore what GraphQL is and why it was created by Meta (formerly known as Facebook). You will learn about the GraphQL type system and operation syntax.

During this chapter, we will write our first GraphQL query and create our very first GraphQL server using Hot Chocolate.

## Prerequisites

For this workshop, you will need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to work with C# code. Ensure you install one of the following IDEs:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
